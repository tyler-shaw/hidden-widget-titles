Allows widget titles to be hidden from display on the front of the website.

== Description ==

**What's It Do?**

Hidden Widget Titles simply allows for widget titles to be visible in the admin panel but not on the website.


**Why Use It?**

WordPress sidebars with a large amount of widgets can get pretty hard on the eyes. This plugin allows you give the widgets names for organization purposes in the admin panel, while preventing those titles from being needlessly output on your website.


**How Does It Work?**

Very simply. If you wish to hide the entire title, simply add a ! as the first character in the title. If you wish to hide sections of the title, surround those sections with square brackets [];


**Roadmap**

This plugin is very simple and serves a specific purpose. For this reason, there are no planned features. However, the plugin is actively maintained.

If you have an idea, suggest it.


**Notes**

*   The plugin will have unexpected results if you nest hidden sections, such as: [hidden [title]]
